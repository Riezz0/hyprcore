sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riezz0/hyprcore/refs/heads/main/get-repo.sh)"
```

# IMPORTANT NOTE 🤓
Ensure you type "exit" once oh-my-zsh has installed and 
you have set it as the default shell so that the remainder of 
the installation may continue

This is still a W.I.P 😊

1. This setup might not be compatible with your setup. 
2. Ensure you install SDDM greeter in your arch install.
3. Install pywalfox for Firefox Theming.
4. Hardware Used - AMD CPU And GPU.
